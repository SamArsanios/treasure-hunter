This is a game where you play the role of an aircraft and collect as many coins as possible avoiding obstacles(lightning bolts).

++++ Movement ++++
=> To play this game, the player has to move the aircraft upwards or downwards using a mouse click or a screen tap on a touchscreen as it flies towards the right of the screen.
=> The coins and obstacles appear on random positions throughout the game.

++++ Scores ++++
=> A player collects points as he collects the coins and dodges the obstacles that appear from the right side of the screen. 
=> Each coin is worth 1 point, so ensure to collect as much as you can to be the best of the best.

++++ Game Over ++++
=> The game ends when the plane hits an obstacle. 
=> The score which is the total number of coins collected by the plane is saved and 
can be viewed in the scoreboard. 
=> The player is prompted to retry to play the game again.

++++ Future additions ++++
In the future, I will try to add difficulty of the game by increasing its speed.
